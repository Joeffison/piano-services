  "service_description_tuning": "Piano tuning is the precise string tension adjustment of the roughly 230 strings in the piano. Routine tuning is essential to maintaining the long-term tuning stability of any piano. A piano should be tuned at least once annually because the tuning will be altered by seasonal humidity fluctuation. If a piano has not been tuned in longer than one or two years, it may need a pitch raise in addition to the fine tuning in order for the tuning to hold properly.",
  "Regulation": "Regulation",
  "service_description_regulation": "Every piano has roughly 12,000 to 14,000 moving parts, depending on how they are counted. Over time, felt and leather between parts compacts, and wood warps slightly. The regulation process deals with adjusting all these moving parts. It is important to have a piano regulated periodically to keep the touch consistent and to return everything to its optimal level of functionality.",
